# brokers-tekton

This repository contains an example system that links `Knative Brokers` to `Tekton Triggers` to spawn Pipelines to demo this powerful pattern and have some fun, too.

The demo provides tooling which handles creating a fully functioning k8s demo environment locally using Kind. Follow, we will check out this pattern further by following a workflow using ko and kail to iterate on some changes and view logs.

Get started experimenting with the system by following along with the [workshop](/workshop/README.md)!

## Purpose

This project meant as education workshop material to allow interested folks to experiment with a real, running event-driven system with very little overhead in a no-mess, no-fuss learning environment.
